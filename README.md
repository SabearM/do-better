Hello World!
I am 68 years old trying to build my first website that I can be proud of, but running into issues here and there.
I published a website few years ago that had some major issues and was not really interactive and very boring one page site.
I have watched a few tutorials that have been helpful, and I can follow and write codes and understand what I'm doing...until it gets to bootstrap, js, and jquery and I damn near loose it all. One problem seems to be that these are older tutorials and older versions of the programs that are no longer available, and for some reason I can't seem to download the newer versions.
I am using PC with windows 10.

Help World!
